# CubesDemo
A simple VR demo project for educational purposes using the Oculus Integration package.

Scenes/CubesDemo.scene is the example scene, and there is an example script in the Scripts folder.
Locomotion and grabbing are enabled in the example scene, but you can disable the Locomotion scripts if you only need room-scale movement.
You will need the latest LTS version in the Unity 2019.4 series with Android build support. We recommend Visual Studio as an IDE, since it has the best integration with Unity.
The Editor might ask you to upgrade the project version. All project members must use the same exact Unity version.
You can develop faster by switching the platform from Android to PC and running the project in the editor in Play mode.
